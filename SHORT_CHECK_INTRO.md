# Short Check ‚Äî Quick Introduction

## What is Short Check?

Short Check is a tool that analyzes dilution tracker screenshots to quickly identify high-quality short trade opportunities. Instead of manually reviewing dilution data, upload a screenshot and get an instant risk assessment.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a Screenshot**: Drag, drop, paste, or select a screenshot from your dilution tracker (Dilution Tracker, FinTwit, etc.)
2. **OCR Processing**: The app uses AI to extract key financial data (cash runway, float, dilution tools, etc.)
3. **Instant Scoring**: Get a 0-100% rating indicating short trade quality
4. **Risk Analysis**: See alert labels, red flags, and a plain-English risk synopsis

## Key Features

### üìä **Smart Scoring System**
- **High-Priority Short Candidate** (70-100%): Strong setup with multiple risk factors
- **Moderate Short Candidate** (40-70%): Decent setup, worth monitoring
- **Speculative Short Candidate** (20-40%): Weak setup, lower conviction
- **No-Trade** (<20%): Not a good short opportunity

### üö® **Alert Labels**
Visual chips highlight critical conditions:
- üî¥ **Cash Raise Likely**: Runway < 2 months AND burn > $1M
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Low Float Risk**: Float < 3M shares
- üü† **Max Dilution Tools**: ATM + S-1 + Convertibles all present

### üè∑Ô∏è **Red Flag Tags**
Quick visual indicators on each score category:
- üî¥ **Urgent** (Cash Runway < 3 months)
- üß® **Active Shelf** (ATM/S-1 in place)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weak Support** (Institutional ownership < 2%)
- üéà **Thin Float** (Float < 5M)
- üìà **Elevated** (Short interest > 6%)

### üìà **Integrated Pump Scorecard Analysis**
After uploading a screenshot, enter the ticker to get:
- **Droppiness Analysis**: Historical spike behavior
- **Pump Risk Scorecard**: Comprehensive risk breakdown
- **SEC Filings**: Recent filings and dilution events
- **Promotions & Fraud Evidence**: Red flag detection
- **Charts & Fundamentals**: Full market context

### üìù **Plain-English Risk Synopsis**

> "XYZ has only 1.2 months of runway and multiple active dilution tools. With a float of 2.4M shares and institutional ownership of just 0.8%, it may face selling pressure."
